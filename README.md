<h3 align="left">Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cris!<br>
I'm a student at Start2Impact University and this is my practical project for the React framework course.</h3>
<p align="left">For this project, I've created a website that facilitates meditation. The essential feature is a timer that users can set to determine the duration of the activity.</h3>

# Home
The application consists of a simple homepage that invites the user to start with meditation.<br>
When the user clicks on the '<strong>GET STARTED</strong>' button, they access the second page of the application where they find the timer.<br>
